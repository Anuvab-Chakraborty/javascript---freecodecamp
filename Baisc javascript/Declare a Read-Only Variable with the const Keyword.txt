In JavaScript we cannot change the const variable 
but we can change the let variable.  So keeping that
in mind we can write this following code as an example:

const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
